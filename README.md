My Submissions to hacker earth competitions

1. Predict the DEFCON Level.
This challenge can be viewed [here](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-defcon-level/).
Goal of this challenge is to predict the DEFCON level by using the given predictors.
I tried using Random Forest, XGboost, CatBoost and AutoML Frameworks/Libraries and tuned the hyperparameters to increase the accuracy.
My Worldwide Rank in this challenge is 18th and can be viewed here on the [leaderboard](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-defcon-level/leaderboard/predict-the-defcon-level-21dcfc30/).
